### Breakout Variation Ideas

### Interesting Existing Game Variations

 * Ballz - This variant involves the player picking the direction at which to release a series of "balls" at blocks from
 the bottom of the screen. These randomly spaced blocks and have different values indicating how many times a ball
 must collide with it before it disappears. Each iteration the blocks move down further towards the bottom of the screen.
 The player loses when a block hits the bottom of the screen without being destroyed.

 * Vortex - This variant is interesting because it takes normal brick breaker and warps the stage so that the paddle
 rotates around layers of concentric brick rings. The color and appearance of each brick indicates how many more hits it
 takes to destroy it. Another interesting geometric feature of vortex is that it appears three dimensional, with bricks
 of higher levels partially covering those beneath them. The game also gives the impression that the ball is falling 
 downward towards the bricks. 


#### Block Ideas

 * Variable hits - certain blocks require more collisions for the ball to destroy them

 * Explosive - if destroyed, does damage to blocks within a certain radius

 * Protected - A certain side of the brick is 
 
 * Speed change - increases or decreases the speed at which the ball travels
 
 * Bounce tweaker - changes the physics of how the ball bounces off of blocks/walls/paddles

 * Paddle size - shrinks paddle


#### Power Up Ideas

 * Paddle size - Increases paddle size

 * Extra ball - adds an extra ball that the paddle can launch

 * Double damage - each collision of the ball causes twice the damage to a brick as before.
