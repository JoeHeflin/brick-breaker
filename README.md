Name: Robert Hellinga, 

### Timeline

Start Date: September 13, 2020

Finish Date: September 28, 2020

Hours Spent: 25-30

### Resources Used

design.cs.duke.edu


### Running the Program

Main class: Game.java

Data files needed: level1.txt, level2.txt, etc... (found in levelFormats folder)

Key/Mouse inputs: left and right to move, mouse to fire the ball. Use mouse to navigate
the menu

Cheat keys: 

•P: Pauses the game

•N: Progresses to a new level

Known Bugs: Very occasionally, the ball will phase through a brick instead of bouncing off.
The bug is hard to accurately replicate and rarely occurs, but it does happen.

Extra credit:

Cut screens (opening/ending, win/loss)

Notable bonus features: 

•dynamic bouncing off of the paddle

•Easily expandable level pool (until the level select text wraps off the 
screen)


### Notes/Assumptions
INSTRUCTIONS:

• Use the arrow keys to move and the mouse to fire the ball 


### Impressions

The implementation of Brick Breaker here is relatively basic, but the structure of the
code allows for easy expansion/customization towards whatever direction a programmer 
seeks to take it. We chose to focus on building a strong framework for our code that was
easy to add new bricks power ups and levels to.
